Please see attached. Primary solution is based on runnning for loops and counters. I have to believe there is some way to take the csv file and write it into a list or dictionary and then run metrics off the lists or dictionary. That said, I could not figure it out. 
As of Tuesday evening, I have no clue how to take my results as represented as printed text in a terminal and write them into a txt file. I have seen a number of different examples on the web but was unable to apply any of them to my script. I imagine it isn't that hard, i.e. I imagine I am missing something really basic here. TA appointment on Wednesday to see if that will get me over the hurdle. 

Wednesday 9.30 Comment addition ... Files should meet the homework requirements. Text file issues resolved. I (with help of tutor) had to rework the format of the text output contents to be able to write to the text file. Specifically the syntax of the text file output had to go to using { } and eliminate the use of + (plus sign) and many of the ' (single quotations) to get the text files written. This is clearly seen if you look at the different syntax between the terminal and the text file prints.
